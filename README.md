## Introduction
- Liver steatosis, the abnormal accumulation of fat within hepatocytes, presents a significant health concern globally, with implications ranging from mild liver dysfunction to severe conditions such as  non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Macrovesicular steatosis, characterized by large fat vacuoles within hepatocytes, is a particularly important subtype of liver steatosis, often associated with more severe liver damage and disease progression. Accurate detection and quantification of macrovesicular steatosis are critical for diagnosing liver conditions, assessing disease severity, and guiding treatment decisions. However, current methods for evaluating steatosis, such as visual assessment by pathologists or automated image analysis techniques, often lack the precision and efficiency needed for reliable clinical diagnosis and research purposes.Automated image analysis techniques, while offering potential improvements in efficiency and objectivity, often rely on handcrafted features or shallow learning models, limiting their ability to capture complex patterns and variations in histological images accurately. Additionally, existing approaches may struggle to differentiate between different types and degrees of steatosis or may not generalize well to diverse datasets, including samples stained with different techniques or obtained from different imaging modalities.

## Applications 
- The scope of the proposed project encompasses the development and validation of a novel computational framework for the assessment of macrovesicular steatosis in human liver tissue using Vision Transformers (ViTs). This framework will involve pre-processing histological images, extracting relevant features, training ViT models, and evaluating their performance in detecting and quantifying steatosis accurately.
The application of this project spans various domains within hepatology and medical imaging. Firstly, the developed computational tool has the potential to aid pathologists and clinicians in diagnosing liver steatosis more accurately and efficiently. By providing quantitative measures of steatosis severity, the tool can enhance clinical decision-making, treatment planning, and patient monitoring in conditions such as NAFLD and NASH.
